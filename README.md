# TH Project 2

This project was built to satisfy the requirements of the second Treehouse FSJS Tech Degree project. 

My goal was to manipulate the visibility of a large amount of data presented via the index.html file. The JS applied paginates the 
the list as well as allows the list to be searched dynamically via the search bar.
